To configure User-ID on the Palo Alto HA firewall using Terraform, you can use the panos_user_id resource. Below is an example of how to define User-ID configurations in your Terraform script.

Step-by-Step Plan
    1.  Define User-ID Agent:
            Create User-ID agent configurations to map users to IP addresses.
            Specify the necessary parameters such as server, port, and authentication.
    2.  Attach User-ID to Security Rules:
            Apply the User-ID configurations to the relevant security rules.

Execution
    1.  Save the Terraform script in a file named main.tf.
    2.  Save the Python script in a file named deploy.py.
    3.  Run the Python script to execute the Terraform script and configure the firewall:

            python deploy.py

Verification
    To verify the User-ID configuration, you can use the Palo Alto web interface or CLI commands. For CLI verification, you can use:

# Check User-ID agent configuration
show user user-id-agent state all

This will display the configured User-ID agents and their states on the firewall. Adjust the Terraform script as needed to match your specific User-ID requirements.
