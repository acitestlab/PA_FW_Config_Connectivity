4.  Configure security policies on the Palo Alto HA firewall

To configure security policies on the Palo Alto HA firewall using Terraform, you can use the panos_security_policy resource. Below is an example of how to define security policies in your Terraform script.

    a.  Step-by-Step Plan
            i.  Define Security Policies:
            ii. Create security policies to allow or deny traffic between zones.
            iii.Specify source and destination zones, addresses, and applications.
            iv. Define actions (allow, deny, etc.).

Execution
    1.  Save the Terraform script in a file named main.tf.
    2.  Save the Python script in a file named deploy.py.
    3.  Run the Python script to execute the Terraform script and configure the firewall:

            python deploy.py

Verification
    To verify the security policies, you can use the Palo Alto web interface or CLI commands as mentioned earlier. For CLI verification, you can use:

    # Check security policies
        show running security-policy

This will display the configured security policies on the firewall. Adjust the Terraform script as needed to match your specific security policy requirements.
