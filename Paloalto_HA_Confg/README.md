Palo alto Firewall Connectivity Configuration 

To create terraform script to configure Palo alto HA firewall vitual context firewall, assign dmz internal and external interfaces to it, assign IP addresses to each interface, create Internal and external zones, configure OSPF and stactic route to the WAN router. Include the python automation script to execute the terraform script and create the variables.

Step-by-Step Plan
1.  Terraform Script:
    Define provider and version.
    Configure Palo Alto HA firewall.
    Create virtual context firewall.
    Assign DMZ, internal, and external interfaces.
    Assign IP addresses to each interface.
    Create internal and external zones.
    Configure OSPF.
    Configure static route to the WAN router.
    Python Automation Script:

2.  Install necessary libraries.
    Define variables.
    Execute the Terraform script.

Execution
    1.  Save the Terraform script in a file named main.tf.
    2.  Save the Python script in a file named deploy.py.
    3.  Run the Python script to execute the Terraform script and configure the firewall:

    $ python deploy.py

==========    ==========  | ============================================

To verify the configuration of the Palo Alto HA firewall after running the Terraform script, you can use the following methods:

1.  Check via Palo Alto Web Interface:
        Log in to the Palo Alto firewall's web interface.
        Navigate to the relevant sections (e.g., Network > Interfaces, Network > Zones, Network > Virtual Routers) to verify the configuration.
2.  Check via CLI:
        Log in to the Palo Alto firewall via SSH.
        Use the following CLI commands to verify the configuration:

            # Check interfaces
            show interface all

            # Check zones
            show zone all

            # Check virtual routers
            show routing route

            # Check OSPF configuration
            show routing protocol ospf

            # Check static routes
            show routing route static

3.  Automated Verification via Python Script:
        You can use the pandevice library to automate the verification process. In paverifydevice.py you will find an example of Python script to verify the configuration:

    a. Execution
        i.  Install the pandevice library if you haven't already:
            pip install pandevice
        ii. Save the verification script in a file named verify.py.
        iii.Run the verification script:
            python verify.py

This script will connect to the Palo Alto firewall and print out the configuration details for interfaces, zones, virtual routers, OSPF, and static routes. Adjust the script as needed to match your specific configuration and requirements.
