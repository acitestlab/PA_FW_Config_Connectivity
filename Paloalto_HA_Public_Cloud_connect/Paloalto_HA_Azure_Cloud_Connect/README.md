Step-by-Step Plan
    1.  Terraform Configuration:
        Define resources for Azure VPN.
        Use a separate variables file for configuration.
    2.  Python Script:
        Use the Palo Alto Networks API to configure the HA firewall.
        Use a separate configuration file for variables.

Terraform Configuration
    Prerequisites
        Install Terraform: https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli
        Configure Azure provider in Terraform.

    Terraform Script
        Create a file named main.tf with the following content:

Execution
    Section One
    1.  Save the Python script in a file named configure_pa_firewall.py.
    2.  Ensure you have the required Python packages installed.
    3.  Run the script:

        python configure_pa_firewall.py

    Section Two
    1.  Save the Python script in a file named azure_vpn.py.
    2.  Ensure you have the required Python packages installed.
    3.  Run the script:

        python azure_vpn.py

Verification
    To verify the VPN configuration, you can use the Palo Alto web interface or CLI commands, as well as the Azure and AWS management consoles.

For Palo Alto CLI verification:
# Check IPsec tunnel status
show vpn ipsec-sa

# Check IKE gateway status
show vpn ike-sa
