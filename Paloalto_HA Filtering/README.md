Below is an example of a Terraform script with a variables file to filter security policies on a Palo Alto firewall. Additionally, a Python script is included to run the Terraform script.


Steps to Use
    1.  Install the required Terraform provider for Palo Alto (panos).
    2.  Place the above files in the same directory.
    3.  Update terraform.tfvars with your firewall details and desired rule name.
    4.  Run the Python script:

            python3 run_terraform.py
    
    
To run this setup, follow these steps:

    1.  Install Terraform: Ensure Terraform is installed on your system. You can download it from Terraform's official website.

    2.  Install the Palo Alto Terraform Provider:
            a.  Add the required provider configuration in your Terraform setup (already present in main.tf).
            b.  Run terraform init to download the provider.
    3.  Update Variables:
            a.  Open the terraform.tfvars file (Paloalto_HA Filtering/terraform.tfvars).
            b.  Update the hostname, username, password, vsys, and rule_name variables with your firewall details.
    4.  Run the Python Script:
            a.  Execute the Python script run_terraform.py (Paloalto_HA Filtering/run_terraform.py) to initialize and apply the Terraform configuration:

            python3 run_terraform.py

    5.  View Output:
            The script will display the filtered security policies based on the rule_name specified in terraform.tfvars.
