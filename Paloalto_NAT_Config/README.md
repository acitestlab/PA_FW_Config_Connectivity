To configure NAT (Network Address Translation) on the Palo Alto HA firewall using Terraform, you can use the panos_nat_rule resource. Below is an example of how to define NAT rules in your Terraform script.

Step-by-Step Plan
    1.  Define NAT Rules:
        Create NAT rules to translate source or destination addresses.
        Specify source and destination zones, addresses, and translated addresses.



Execution
    1.  Save the Terraform script in a file named main.tf.
    2.  Save the Python script in a file named deploy.py.
    3.  Run the Python script to execute the Terraform script and configure the firewall:

        python deploy.py

Verification
    To verify the NAT configuration, you can use the Palo Alto web interface or CLI commands. For CLI verification, you can use:

# Check NAT rules
show running nat-policy

This will display the configured NAT rules on the firewall. Adjust the Terraform script as needed to match your specific NAT requirements.
