To create a Terraform script to configure VPN on the Palo Alto HA firewall with Azure and AWS, you need to define the necessary resources in Terraform for both cloud environments and then use a Python script to configure the Palo Alto firewall.

Step-by-Step Plan
    1.  Terraform Configuration:
            Define resources for Azure VPN.
            Define resources for AWS VPN.
    2.  Python Script:
            Use the Palo Alto Networks API to configure the firewall.




To configure a VPN on the Palo Alto HA firewall with Azure and AWS, you need to set up IPsec VPN tunnels between the Palo Alto firewall and the respective cloud environments. This involves configuring the VPN settings on both the Palo Alto firewall and the cloud environments.


Step-by-Step Plan
    1.  Configure VPN on Palo Alto Firewall:
            Define IKE Gateway.
            Define IPsec Tunnel.
            Define Tunnel Interface.
            Define Static Routes.
    2.  Configure VPN on Azure:
            Create a Virtual Network Gateway.
            Configure the Local Network Gateway.
            Create a Connection.
    3.  Configure VPN on AWS:
            Create a Virtual Private Gateway.
            Configure the Customer Gateway.
            Create a VPN Connection.
    4.  Python Script to Automate Configuration:
            Use the Palo Alto Networks API to configure the firewall.
            Use Azure and AWS SDKs to configure the cloud environments.

Prerequisites
        Install the required Python packages:
                pip install requests
                pip install requests azure-mgmt-network boto3
                pip install azure-mgmt-network
                pip install azure-identity
