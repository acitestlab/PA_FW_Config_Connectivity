To configure security profiles on the Palo Alto HA firewall using Terraform, you can use the panos_security_profile_group resource. Below is an example of how to define security profiles and attach them to security rules in your Terraform script.

Step-by-Step Plan
    1.  Define Security Profiles:
            Create security profiles such as Anti-Spyware, Antivirus, URL Filtering, etc.
            Group these profiles into a security profile group.
    2.  Attach Security Profile Group to Security Rules:
        Apply the security profile group to the relevant security rules.


Verification
    To verify the security profiles and their application to security rules, you can use the Palo Alto web interface or CLI commands. For CLI verification, you can use:

# Check security profiles
show running security-profile

# Check security policies with profiles
show running security-policy

This will display the configured security profiles and their application to security policies on the firewall. Adjust the Terraform script as needed to match your specific security profile requirements
