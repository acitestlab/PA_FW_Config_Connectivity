To configure SSL decryption on the Palo Alto HA firewall using Terraform, you can use the panos_ssl_decrypt resource. Below is an example of how to define SSL decryption rules in your Terraform script.

Step-by-Step Plan
    1.  Define SSL Decryption Rules:
            Create SSL decryption rules to decrypt inbound and outbound SSL traffic.
            Specify source and destination zones, addresses, and actions.


Execution
    1.  Save the Terraform script in a file named main.tf.
    2.  Save the Python script in a file named deploy.py.
    3.  Run the Python script to execute the Terraform script and configure the firewall:

        python deploy.py

Verification
    To verify the SSL decryption configuration, you can use the Palo Alto web interface or CLI commands. For CLI verification, you can use:  

# Check SSL decryption rules
show running ssl-decrypt

This will display the configured SSL decryption rules on the firewall. Adjust the Terraform script as needed to match your specific SSL decryption requirements.
